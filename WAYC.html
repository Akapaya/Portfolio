			<p class="AboutMeTexts P1">This project is a game made for a GameJam held in 2020 for developers from Baixada Santos - São Paulo, the theme was a pandemic, I ran away from the idea of something directly related to the virus, and focused on what humanity was going through, and inspired by my relationship I made a game about a couple who try to keep their relationship alive from a distance.</p>

		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Idea</p>
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  This game was made for a 2-week Gamejam, it was the beginning of the Pandemic so the theme was just about the current issue that humanity was going through, I strayed a little from the basics of focusing the game on the pandemic and the virus, and giving More emphasis on what I was going through at the time, maintaining long-distance relationships became a complicated task for many, whether romantic, family or friendship relationships..
		</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  And while we need to live this way, we also get stuck carrying out our daily tasks, which often become boring and repetitive, so the idea was for each task to be a simple minigame, as well as many ideas on how to play with children in the middle of the pandemic, most famously as "the floor is lava".
		</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  So the idea came from this proposal for a long-distance relationship, the game is casual for two people to play together, the minigames are simple so that even if your partner is not very familiar with it, they will be able to play calmly.
		</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  The screen is divided, and each player controls one of the characters in their respective homes, perform their daily tasks which are minigames such as "Cleaning the house", "Working", "Cooking", among other common activities, and after each task performed the Players must exchange messages via cell phone, which is how the story is told, through the messages exchanged contextualizing their situations and events in the game's universe.
		</p>

        <p class="StorysTitle Title">The Development</p>
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  This was another project that I carried out alone due to time, but I managed to prepare well and plan for the development to happen without problems. I already expected the GameJam theme to be related to the pandemic, which made my planning easier.</p>
		  <ul class="StoryList">
		  	<p class="StorysTexts P1">

			<img class="StoryImgs" src="imgs/WAYC/schedule.png">

	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  One detail to add, at that time I worked at a school that promoted gaming courses, I was responsible for one of the teams of students who participated in GameJam, but I left it open to their choice to try it alone and just ask me questions, how they would choose Following this path I took the opportunity to also do my project, so to adapt to work, mentoring if the team of students needed it and the development of my project, the schedule was created with this in mind.</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  The programs used were Magica Voxel for modeling, Blender for model optimization, Piskel for PixelArt and unity as the engine.</p>

	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Game Systems</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
These are the systems reformulated for the new version of the game and code improvement, using mainly DesignPatterns such as State Machine and MVC, in addition to good practices and S.O.L.I.D principles.</p>
	<img class="StoryImgs" src="imgs/WAYC/GameManagerWhenHome.png">
	<img class="StoryImgs" src="imgs/WAYC/Types.png">

	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The 3D Models</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  The models were made using the Magica Voxel tool, it is a very good tool for making 3D models using cubes quickly, it makes the work easier if you don't have time to model something from scratch.</p>
		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  However, the problem with this tool at the time was that because of how the texture works on top of the model, the model came with many more polygons than necessary, and the texture was just a color table image, which made me need the Blender to optimize the models and create textures in a way that I could edit without having to open Magica Voxel again.</p>
		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  The house was modeled all at once within Magica, and later optimized in Blender, the old house was made to look more like a KitNet, which would make it clearer how the new house was superior to the old one, which previously seemed like a only room, in the new one there is already a better division, the room is divided by the bookshelf, there is now a wall dividing the kitchen rooms with the counter, the bathroom is the only thing left out of the modeling, being represented only by a door.</p>

	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
		  The characters were made using MagicaVoxel`s example characters as a base.</p>

        <iframe src="https://app.vectary.com/p/4jChwrnGWx6ComAeoxkHXr" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-pointer-lock allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>

        <p class="StorysTexts P1">Showing what the models of this version currently look like, I would like to show the upgrade that the game will take in the future, I will use examples of Al and/or public models.</p>
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">I believe that the visual will be more important if the personality of the characters is conveyed, something that with the voxel graphic style cannot be conveyed due to the lack of details, so the idea is to do something aimed at LowPoly, so the characters become more caricatured and easier to identify with the public, a very simple example would be aimed at the LGBT public, where in the voxel drawing the flag would lose a lot of quality, and in LowPoly it is much clearer and easier for players to identify themselves in the characters.</p>

	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Animations</p>
        
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">
In the current version, the animations are simple, there's not much to comment on, the movement animation in the first version was just a little jump between steps, which later became a common walk with changing "Sprites" models to interpret the movement.</p>

	<p class="StorysTexts P1">
What in the new version would be very different, with LowPoly it would already require a bone Rig to animate it, which gives the characters even more personality.</p>

<p class="StorysTitle Title">The PixelArt/Minigames</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Some minigames the idea was to do 2D style, I used Piskel to draw, I'm not a good Piskel designer but some results were interesting.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
The 2D minigames that involve pixel art are "Working", "Cooking", "Dishwashing" and "Sleeping".</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Cooking Minigame is inspired by the CupHead format, a food with attacks and
the player must finish off the boss, in this case he shoots with a firearm, as if he were frying the food.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Cooking.png">

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Working Minigame is a computer screen inspired by Windows XP, where you have to take files from one side to the other by uploading them to the server, but without getting caught by the errors that the cloud throws along the way.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Work.png">

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Dishwashing Minigame is a spaceship shooter where the dishes appear in a parabola in front of the player.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Dishes.png">

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Bedtime Minigame is inspired by the Dinosaur game, where he walks automatic and obstacles appear, he must jump over them all and get the letters Z.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Sleep.png">

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Now moving on to the 3D Minigames, which are just two, "Cleaning the house" and "Laundry".</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Tidying up the house minigame was the first one I made with the theme of the floor being lava, some cardboard moving boxes appear and they need to jump on them to pick up the scattered books and put them on the shelf.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Lava.png">

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Laundry Minigame 3 random clothes are spawned around the house, they move spontaneously around the house, you need to collect all the clothes to complete the task.</p>

<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/WAYC/Clothes.png">

<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Sound track</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
Unfortunately the music is my most complicated part, I'm terrible at knowing whether a set of notes are pleasant or not, but I tried my best to make the music and the effects please me.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">
I tried to make the music relaxing but with an 8-bit feel, and it turned out like that.</p>

	  <p class="StorysTitle Title">The Final Result</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">
The final result for GameJam was quite satisfactory, both due to the game's creativity with the theme, and the simplicity of execution, I came in second place out of 10 teams if I'm not mistaken, many commented on the game being ready to be commercialized, however I kept it in storage for a long time, recently returning to improve its systems and with ideas to really make it marketable, as I said with the change in graphic style and having more stories besides the main one about the straight couple, I have ideas about making stories with couples LGBTs and family relationships too, but this will take a long time.</p>

        <p class="StorysTitle Title">The Conclusions</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">
It was a sensational experience creating this game in just 2 weeks, I'm proud of it because it takes in its story the strongest point I have about life which is love, so there's a lot of feeling in its creation, trying to show that if love exists, he wins everything, and that view of mine hasn't changed to this day, even though in my real life I gave a GameOver to the relationship at that time.</p>

<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Story</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The story I wanted to convey in this version of the game was a story inspired by what I went through, a couple separated by the pandemic, they respect the distance and try to keep the relationship alive through the conversations they had every day.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">The game takes place over 5 days, but with a passage of time between days, the first day takes place in January, after the end of the day there is a passage of time of 1 month, and the next day takes place in February, and so on.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">On the first day they are still excited about the new house, which the woman went ahead to fix, and the man stayed in the old one to deal with potential buyers, but things are getting more difficult, the pandemic and isolation last longer than they expected, and everyone is going through difficulties so it is difficult to find a buyer.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">After a few months of no news, the man even starts to get scared that things won't be resolved, thinking that the grasshoppers appearing in his windows are a bad omen, and even the closure of the roads prevents them from meeting even if they found a buyer.</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">Arriving at the end, good news begins to appear, the roads are open again, and the owner of the building where the man lived, volunteers to take care of the apartment until they find a buyer, so the need for a long-distance relationship ends and the couple can meet again.</p>

<p class="StorysTitle Title">The StoryTelling</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">At the beginning we see the couple's conversation on the cell phone of the latest events, the woman in the new house, while he is still in the old house, after this introduction the cell phone shrinks and divides the players' screens, each character must send a message on the cell phone to give continuity, after sending, a random task is released for each person, when starting the task a simple minigame will appear, and after both complete their minigames they will be able to send a new message to their partner, this is repeated until they complete all the daily tasks of the game. day, which will begin the task of sleeping and a new day to continue the story.</p>
