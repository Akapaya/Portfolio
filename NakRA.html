		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Idea</p>
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">My idea for the game was to use my pet Nak, but I still didn't know what the
gameplay or the story would be like yet, so little by little the people who would be part of my team joined, many ideas came up, like making a turn-based combat style RPG. Pokemon.
		</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">But with the desire of some to tinker with 3D, and the demonstration of the tool we use most for modeling in Voxel, we changed the aesthetic we wanted, but there was still the difficulty in choosing what or how the game would be played.
		</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">So in the ethics and morals class we were given the idea of making a game with a positive message, or that highlighted a problem, so we had to make sure the game involved animals (My mascot is a Rabbit Slime, but in this game we were just with his Rabbit part), being a cute game, but thinking about problems involving animals, so we thought about cosmetics companies that use animals as guinea pigs for product testing.
		</p>

<section id="section4"></section>
        <p class="StorysTitle Title">The Concepts</p>
        <p class="StorysTexts P1">The first animation concept made was to show how the camera would be
controlled, with Nak walking (Jumping) to the other side, the camera rotates around Nak, the walls in front of the camera become transparent to prevent it from getting in the way the player's vision.</p>

		</video>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The second animation concept was an example of what a phase of the game would be like, Nak starts at the door of a room in a safe place, in the room there will be cats that patrol the room, the red light shows the place where you need to avoid, and with the elements of the phase Nak can advance until he reaches the objective, even using air ducts to hide or take shortcuts, in the end he saves his first companion, the dog.</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The third Concept showed what would be one of the main unique mechanics for Nak, where he can enter from under boxes that have an open bottom, to avoid being seen.</p>

		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Development</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">So, with a lot of things defined, we started development, while I developed the mechanics and systems, I helped with the design of the phases to make good use of the environment so that the gameplay connects with the whole.</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">We have some examples of how the systems were developed, such as movement, the transparency of walls and the visualization of cats through raycast.</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">Programming the cats' vision was certainly the most difficult thing during my studies, I had to search for information a lot, but in the end it was a very satisfactory result.</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">A problem that persisted until the end of the TCC was related to the lighting of the room along with the lighting of the cats' eyes, I racked my brains to solve it, and weeks before completion I bought a course on Lighting on Udemy, which taught me the I needed to fix it.</p>

<section id="section6"></section>
	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Animations</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The modelers' main doubt was how the animations would be done, they had no knowledge of this part yet, so as I had already done some 3D animations using Minecraft characters for study, I suggested that we use this form of animation where each part is separate. of the body, and we moved independently, so I ended up taking care of the animations.</p>

	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Rooms Designs</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">As previously mentioned, I helped a lot with the level design because I needed to include the mechanics we created to use the environment to your advantage, so here are some examples of the scenarios created.</p>

	<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Selection Screen</p>
	<p class="StorysTexts P1">The phase selection screen, our teacher gave a great idea of being the floor plan of the floor, so it is a corridor where there are 5 doors on each side, and to go to the next floor we go back to the elevator and choose the floor we want, We also included minigames at the end of the hallway inspired by famous Atari games.</p>

<section id="section9"></section>
		<p class="StorysTitle Title">Two Characters</p>	

		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">In the end, the game's main idea was to have at least the first floor made with 10 rooms, but we managed to finish 2 floors made, which is 20 rooms, and the 10 new rooms on the second floor include the use of the Dog already in your party.</p>
		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">Now with the dog we added the possibility of changing characters during the level, we wanted the animals in the party to help each other to complete the room, so with the selection of numbers you could switch between the Rabbit and the Dog.</p>
		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">The Dog also had its unique mechanics such as Barking that would paralyze nearby cats, and moving boxes to other places so that the rabbit could climb to higher places, so the rooms become more complex and the skills are completed.</p>

		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Multiplayer</p>	

		  <p class="StorysTexts P1">As we had two characters, we also tested split-screen multiplayer, where each player would control one of the animals. It was just a beta test but it worked very well.</p>

		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Conclusions</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">This project is one of my favorites and it was my first big project, working with a team and organizing the planning, ideas and making sure everyone was able to complete their parts was a great experience that I am very proud of that we were able to complete.</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">Our project was the most complete game in our class, and as a result we were selected as "The best ETEC TCCs of 2019", which also guaranteed the opportunity to show our project at a partner college of our course.</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The recognition was great, one day I still intend to launch this game commercially, contact my colleagues who participated with me to receive their permission on this matter.</p>

<section id="section12"></section>
		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Story</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">So the central idea was made, a game about animals that are undergoing experiments by a fictional cosmetics company, and then the player would help Nak to leave that company and return to his natural habitat.</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">Starting with the Story, it was written mainly by Livia, with a little help from Enzo and a FEW details that I pointed out to enhance the entire project.</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The story she wrote in a somewhat summarized way was, Nak lived with his family of rabbits in a forest where several other animals lived, such as rats, birds, moles, squirrels and much more, but one day a company called ODell sent his brainwashed cats to kidnap all the animals in that place to serve as guinea pigs, Nak wakes up trapped in a cage, seeing his brother and other baby rabbits trapped too, he tries to escape to help them, with the noise his escape caused, he entered the ventilation, where following the entire maze he found a white cat, he explains that he is not like other cats, at least not anymore, Nak now starts the game on the first floor of the large company building, and needs to pass through all the floors until the last to save his family, each floor is specific for experiments for a type of animal, where Nak gains new allies every time he saves them.</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">Our idea was that the game, even though it sent a heavy message of animal abuse for experiments, the animals, their interactions and the way of telling the story itself would be cute, with that in mind, Livia and I decided that the The story would be told through images drawn in Pixel Art, as I'm not a good artist she took care of all the pixel art for the introduction, credits, minigames and other parts.</p>

		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Models 3D</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">With the idea formed, and starting the concepts along with writing the story, the girls Amanda and Fernanda started creating the first concepts for the characters in 3D.</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">Starting off, I will show the characters that were made by the two modelers.</p>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The cat: They have standard dark fur with red eyes that represent that they were brainwashed, the idea of keeping everyone with the same fur was to open up possibilities if we wanted to make cats with other behavior patterns, so each behavior would be represented by it own fur.</p>

		<iframe src="https://app.vectary.com/p/0lpMK0jIEcZV4tPAyb2qpg" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-pointer-lock allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The rabbit: Our main rabbit is a simple rabbit, his appearance is nothing special, but to give him an extra cuteness we later decided to release little clothes for the animals, each outfit with its own way of unlocking.</p>

		<iframe src="https://app.vectary.com/p/32hMj6aadppGEtRYSMPuzB" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-pointer-lock allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>

		<p class="StorysTexts P1">The dog: The first animal that would be saved by the rabbit would be the dog, we had some ideas about which breed would be honored, and in the end we choose the sausage.</p>

<section id="section14"></section>
		<p class="StorysTitle Title">The StoryTelling</p>
		<p class="StorysTexts P1">We had Storytelling with some ideas, which ended up not even going forward, like throwing a carrot to get the cats` attention.</p>

		<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/NakRA/Story1.png">

		<img  class="StoryImgs" style="max-width: 500px" src="imgs/NakRA/Story2.png">

<section id="section15"></section>
<p class="StorysTitle Title">The Sound track</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">While all these system were being created, our Musician Enzo, who had already helped with the level design, took care of the soundtrack and sound effects, I can't say much about the production as it's not my area, but I remember that we decided together that the music would be happier and inspired a little by 8-bit music, a game we took as an example as a soundtrack was "Anarcute".</p>

<p class="StorysTexts P1">Leave some sample songs that Enzo made for our project.</p>
